# Before Coming to Delft
## Accept the Offer and Activate MyHR
Once you accept the offer, you will receive an email from the department manager containing a table for your personal information. 
Please fill in this table so that the manager can grant you access to MyHR, the Human Resource Service onboarding portal for TU Delft.\\

Access links will be sent to the private email address you provided in the table, delivered in two separate emails. 
The first email will contain a link for you to register for MyHR. 
After registering, you will need to complete your profile using the link in the second email. 
Follow the instructions provided in MyHR to submit the required documents, which include your CV, degree certificate, working hours scheme, and others. \\

Once you have uploaded your documents, they will be verified, and your contract will be issued in approximately two weeks.

> [!caution] Emails From Private Email Address Identified as Spam
> Until your TU account is fully active, vital HR messages may still arrive in your private inbox, so keep checking both addresses. Replies you send from your private account can drift into spam. So to avoid this, we recommand you to put Reza in cc for emails you send to secretary, HR or other colleagues. If you haven’t heard back within a week, involve Reza or send a short Teams message. Once you arrive at the TU, you can ask the CIT to white-list your private e-mail address.

## Relocating
You can find extensive information on nearly every topic you need to know about relocating on [Coming to Delft Service](https://www.tudelft.nl/over-tu-delft/werken-bij-tu-delft/nederland-tu-delft/support-for-international-employees). 
Here, we will share some personal opinions based on our experiences.

### Housing
Housing is a significant challenge in the Netherlands, particularly in Delft and its surrounding areas. 
If you are moving alone, it is advisable to secure a temporary place to stay for a few weeks initially. 
Be cautious about booking long-term housing from abroad.\\

Among the options provided in Coming to Delft Service, the temporary residence offered by DUWO would be the first thing to check with our department's management assistance.
DUWO provides rental accommodations for PhD students at TU Delft for up to six months. 
The available start dates are either the 1st or the 16th of each month. 
However, keep in mind that there is no guarantee of securing a rental from DUWO due to a long waiting list. 
Additionally, this service often comes with extra application and administration fees.\\

If you are looking for a more permanent residence for the next few years, you can check the websites listed on the Coming to Delft Service.
Initially, the high prices and housing shortages in the Netherlands may be daunting. 
Finding a suitable place to live can feel like a full-time job, so it's essential to allow yourself plenty of time to search and actively reach out to potential landlords. 
Make sure to inform your colleagues early on that you are looking for housing, as they may have helpful leads or contacts.\\

### Visa and Permits
It’s essential to check whether you need a work permit before your arrival. 
You can only start your job with a valid work permit if required. 
If you are unsure about the necessity of permission to live and work in the Netherlands, consult the IND website or reach out to HR immediately.\\

After completing the onboarding process on MyHR, you will need to wait for HR to contact you. 
They will assist you with your visa and work permit application. 
You will receive an email containing a link to the TU Delft immigration service website. 
There, you will need to fill in your information and upload the required documents, following the instructions provided on the webpage. 
Here are some tips that may help you complete the forms:

1. For the field labeled "Research Programme," provide a brief description of your research topic. For example, you can put in the topic specified in your job description.
2. Additional topics, such as travel insurance and taxi services from the airport, are explained on this page. Click on the question marks for detailed information about each item. 
3. It’s a good idea to take screenshots of this information for future reference.

Please allow at least four weeks for your request to be processed. 
Therefore, make sure that all necessary documents are prepared in advance and uploaded correctly to save time and reduce the workload in the application process.


### Legalise Key Documents
The municipality will ask for legalised copies of birth and, if relevant, marriage certificates for you and any accompanying family members. 
Obtaining those stamps can be time-consuming and complex, depending on when and where you were born and married. 
Therefore, it is necessary to make sure that you start the process as soon as possible.


## HR Appointment
HR Services will organize an introductory appointment with several incoming employees before the start date.
They will give you an overview of your ToDos on your first days in the Netherlands and valuable information about integrating into Dutch society.
You also have a chance to clear your doubts at this appointment.
However, some of the topics in this meeting must be arranged before this appointment, such as scheduling an appointment with the THIC to register and pick up your resident permit.
