# Your First Days in P4MARS 
Great that you have survived the stack of paperwork and arrived in Delft for an exciting journey, though you will have more later (e.g., to apply for 30\% Ruling). 
Now let's plan for your first day at p4MARS. 

## NetID and `tudelft.nl` Mailbox


Normally, you will receive an email containing your NetID and `tudelft.nl` email address shortly before the start of your contract. 
You can set your password following the instructions in this email. 
However, your access to the account is only available after your contract starts, literally, after 12 am on the first day of your contract. 
If you want to log in outside the university, connecting via VPN is necessary. 
Suppose you should have uploaded a photo for your campus card upfront.
In that case, an email notifying you that your campus card is ready to collect in Aula may be waiting for you in your \textit{tudelft} mailbox. 
Therefore, your first task on the first day is picking up your campus card.\\

After that, you’ll want to meet with Shanta, our lovely department secretary, in her office.
She’ll give you a warm welcome, show you around the faculty and department, lead you to your workspace, and help you collect any gear (laptop, displays, and accessories) you need from ICT. 
Shanta will also help you get access to the AE building and your office. 
And if you ride your bike to work, don’t forget to ask about access to the bike storage—it typically takes about 24 hours for that to be set up. 
Just remember to update your campus card at the reception!\\

Once you’re all settled in, take a moment to relax and enjoy your first cup of free coffee from the coffee machine before the group welcome lunch. 
It’s a perfect opportunity to prepare a fun self-introduction for the team! 
During lunch, you’ll meet your fellow group members in a casual setting (let’s keep it light and fun, avoiding too much work talk). 
After lunch, you’ll have a chance to chat with Reza during your kick-off meeting about your exciting research-ful journey ahead!\\
