# Welcome to p4MARS
We’re thrilled you’re joining our research adventure! 
This guide walks you through everything from paperwork and relocating to useful tools and meeting your new team so you can hit the ground cycling (this is the Netherlands, after all). 
Use it as your checklist and reference during the first few months. The content is divided into four sections:
1. [Before Coming to Delft](Before_Coming)
2. [Your First Days in Delft](First_Days)
3. [Work as a Team](Teamwork)
4. [Useful Tools and Resources](Tools_and_Resources)
 

Despite these informative sources, you are always welcome to talk to other colleagues. We are open-minded and happy to help. Your primary contacts are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Department secretary - Shanta (nearly everything except research)
    \item HR Services (contracts, permits, introductory session)
    \item Your lovely colleagues (daily stuff, work, research)
    \item Your supervisor- Reza (research,  big‑picture planning)
\end{itemize}
